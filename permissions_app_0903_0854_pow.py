# Note:
# - Template files (e.g., 'permissions/list.html') and other necessary files are not included here.
# - You should create these files according to your project's requirements.
# - The CustomUser model is a placeholder and should be properly configured to replace Django's built-in User model.
# - You will need to handle migrations and other database setup as needed.
# - The PermissionView is a basic example and should be expanded with actual permission management logic.
# - The permission_required decorator is used to protect views, but you should also handle permissions in your view logic.
# TODO: 优化性能
# - Error handling is simplified here; in a real-world application, you might want to log these errors or provide more detailed responses.
